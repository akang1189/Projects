PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Standardized testing in the US college admissions process has been widely criticized for underlying bias associated with the SAT & ACT. While many socio-economic factors have been directly linked to performance, we hypothesize average income has the greatest impact on student performance on these tests. Our non-proft seeks to confirm the relationship between average family income and student performance so that we may identify the states with the worst overall participation rate and student performance on the SAT and ACT so we can recommend programs and allocate resources appropriately.

All these examples clearly show an income barrier to entry for those less fortunate. In a capitalistic free market economy, income inequality is directly correlated to student academic performance, and ultimately college admissions. A negatively compounding cycle, poverty trap.


Limitation to the Data:
While this study was eye opening, we believe there is much more data to look into in regard to the socio economic factors influencing students taking these exams. While we only got a brief look into the average family income, we believe a deeper study with access to the detailed breakdown of how government funds were allocated by these school districts, we believe we can really focus on how effective these funds and programs are helping these students. We can conduct a study on how our funds are being used and again to better allocate those resources where change can be directly measured and correlated with funding.


Conclusion:
Based on our analyzed data findings, we can quickly find the states with the lower participation and performance metrics however there were some interesting conclusions stemming from our data. One observation we made was the actually statistics behind the demographics playing an instrumental role in performance. Where we see some states like North Dakota, having the lowest percentile SAT participation rates, we can see an indirect correlation here as the same state also ranks the highest in ACT participation. Another geographic trend we noticed, was the preference for the SAT along the eastern coastal states shown by the lower ACT participation data. 
Our recommendation to tackle the economic bias in these exams is simple, provide more resources to those who need them the most. As in this example, states suchas West Viriginia, Arkansas, and Louisiana fall into the lower family income bracket and as such, testing performance has shown to be affected. We will need to take a deeper dive on how funds can be best used to bridge the economic divide however it would be a good start to allocate funding based on performance metrics. Programs such as funding for meals, educational resources, testing prep, tutoring, and after school programs are the basic needs these students deserve.
