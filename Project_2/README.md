# Project 2 - Ames Housing Data and Kaggle Challenge

Problem Statement

Housing prices have skyrocketed to all time highs in most recent years, is that a good thing? What is causing this and why? Are we destined to repeat the 2007 housing market crash? Or is it different this time around?

We wish to look at the factors driving these record home prices to see if they are caused by short term inputs such as the current state of interest rates or even the price of lumber. We will decide on our investments based on future prediction of these home prices

Conclusions and Recommendations 

Based on our analyzed data findings, we can determine and test the factors most likely to impact the Sales Price. Square footage(total), number rooms/bathrooms, upgraded amenities, quality and add-ons such as AC, Garages and fireplaces have shown to have the most significant impact. 

Normal predictors for home prices show the market is being impacted by other external factors. Factors such as tax cuts, recent stimuli, limited supply and the pandemic have exacerbated the underlying issue. While these factors differ from the 2007-8 Housing crash, similarities are obviousâ€¦. But more research is needed.
