nfl,"I'll give a few of mine to get the ball rolling.

The Minnesota Vikings franchise. They are the only team in the top 10 for all time win percentage that has not won a Super Bowl.

The Arizona Cardinals uniforms. By far the worst uniform in the league. There is not one positive aspect to them. The fans hate them. The players hate them. Both have been vocal about it. Yet the team refuses to change them.

That rule where fumbling out the defense's endzone results in a turnover and a touchback. Just put the ball on the 1 yard line. I don't understand rewarding the defense with a turnover AND 20 yards.

The 2013 Patriots. I still don't know how that team made an AFC Championship Game. 12-4 record too. They had no business doing that well throwing to the likes of Aaron Dobson and Kenbrell Thompkins. With Gronkowski injured all year, Edelman was the only reliable passing option.

nfl,"I know I'm gonna get next to no agreement here, but I think its a reasonable case:

Tannehill has a higher on target percentage and lower bad throw percentage last season according to pro football reference 

Tannehill had more TDs per attempt, more yards per attempt and less interceptions per attempt than Brady last year

Tannehill had a higher passer rating and QBR than Brady last year 

Tannehill added 266 rushing yards and 7 rushing touchdowns to Bradys 6 yds and 3 touchdowns. 

All of this while Tannehill was pressured on a higher percentage of dropbacks and had significantly worse receivers. 

Oh, and just for those who want to play the clutch card - Tannehill had 6 game winning drives and 5 fourth quarter comebacks to 3 apiece for Brady. 

Obviously career wise Brady is leaps and bounds better and despite that last stat, he's still certainly a better overall leader in big games. However, I do think at this point its at least an argument as crazy as it sounds on paper.",Ryan Tannehill is a better quarterback right now than Tom Brady.

nfl,"Reasons for picking Reshad Jones- When fans talk about the best safeties of the last decade, the most common names brought up are Earl Thomas, Kam Chancellor, Harrison Smith and Devin McCourty. Rarely brought up is Reshad Jones, a two-time Pro Bowler who played [more games](https://www.si.com/nfl/dolphins/news/revisiting-reshad-jones-and-examining-his-place-in-miami-dolphins-history) than any other safety in Dolphins history. At Georgia, he would redshirt his first year before making an immediate impact as a true freshman, as he was named to the [Freshman All-America Team](https://georgiadogs.com/news/2007/12/6/Six_Freshmen_Honored_By_CollegeFootballNews_com.aspx) after finishing third on the team in tackles (57) despite only starting 2 games. The next year, he earned Second-team All-SEC honors while leading the team in interceptions (5) and finishing second in tackles (76) while starting 12 games. In 2009, he again earned Second-team All-SEC honors while leading Georgia with 4 interceptions and finishing second with 73 tackles. Jones would then declare for the Draft after the season, with initial expectations being that he would be selected in the [first or second](https://www.espn.com/nfl/draft10/news/story?id=4796520) round. However, despite most mock drafts having Jones going no later than the third round, he would wind up falling all the way to the 5th round of the 2010 NFL Draft, where he was selected by the Miami Dolphins.

Like many late-round rookies, Jones would have to wait before earning playing time in the NFL, as he started the season as a backup and missed a few games with knee and ankle injuries, finishing his first season with 21 tackles, 1 sack and 1 interception. His second season saw him battle 2010 starter Chris Clemons for the starting free safety position, with Jones outplaying Clemons after he suffered a hamstring injury in the preseason, and winning the [starting job](https://www.sun-sentinel.com/sports/fl-xpm-2011-09-12-fl-miami-dolphins-notes-0913-20110912-story.html). 2011 would wind up being an up-and-down year for Jones, as he finished 4th on the team in tackles (67), but battled injuries throughout the season again and even lost his starting job at one point to backup Tyrone Culver, though he regained it after head coach Tony Sparano was replaced by Todd Bowles. In 2012, Jones started all 16 games and finally broke out, leading the Dolphins in interceptions (4) and becoming the [only safety](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1645855-is-dolphins-s-reshad-jones-justified-in-skipping-otas) that year with at least 90 tackles, four interceptions and 2 fumble recoveries. Following the season, Jones initially held out for more money and skipped OTA’s in hopes of a new contract, and [would sign](https://www.nfl.com/news/reshad-jones-miami-dolphins-reach-29-285m-contract-0ap1000000226562) a 4-year, $29 million contract extension in August 2013 and put up a career-high 107 tackles that year. He continued to be a tackling machine, and would finish [second](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/mia/2014.htm) in tackles (80) on the 2014 Dolphins despite serving a 4-game [suspension](https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2014/08/08/reshad-jones-suspended-four-games-for-violating-ped-policy/) for substance abuse. Jones started all 16 games again in 2015 and earned his first Pro Bowl appearance, finishing with the [4th-most](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2015/defense.htm#defense::tackles_combined) tackles (135) in the NFL and the most among defensive backs. After missing much of the 2016 season with a torn rotator cuff, Jones signed a 5-year, $60 million [contract extension](https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2017/03/09/dolphins-reshad-jones-agree-on-contract-extension/) ($35 million guaranteed) with the Dolphins in the offseason. He went on to have another Pro Bowl season, [leading all](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2017/defense.htm) NFL defensive backs in tackles (122).

nba,People on r/Rockets think trading Christian Wood for the Warriors 7th overall pick is selling low. I’ve seen some say that we can offer him to the Cavs for pick number 3,What player on your team is your fan base the most delusional about when it comes to trade value?
nba,"[Wolfson: This probably burying the lead. I texted wtih somebody that knows Ben Simmons incredibly well, that has working knowledge of all things NBA. My text the other day said, how badly because I know the Wolves are fans of Ben Simmons. But my test was, how badly do the Wolves want to trade for Ben Simmons? This individual sent me a text back. It was one word, ""badly"". The Wolves have trade interest in Ben Simmons whether Philly moves him.](https://twitter.com/SKORNorth/status/1409215199697981440)


Worth noting that Wolfson is usually full of shit and doesn't have many sources in the org.","[Darren Wolfson] How badly do the #Timberwolves want to trade for Ben Simmons? ""Badly"""
nba,"I'm not asking ""who is the best"". That is irrelevant and the argument is pointless. My question tho is what is their history?

I've just now realized that Kobe Bryant retired from basketball in 2016 (for some reason I was thinking it was was earlier in the 2000s). Which is crazy to think about because there's a lot that happened during these times for me, I wasn't too much into basketball at that time either but still, the fact he retired 2 years after I graduated high school and got back together with my first girlfriend, it just feels crazy to me.

Anyway tho that's besides the point. He joined 1996 to 2016. That's 20 years and that's a long time. LeBron joined in 2003 (for some reason I was also thinking this was later), which would mean he joined right in the Kobe and Shaq right after they won 3 back to back championships. 

LeBron has also never missed a playoff series either, which would put him in a prime position to play against the greats of that era.

Googling/YouTubing this, it shows only one game where Kobe and LeBron went ""toe to toe"" but I really don't know much else. 

How many times did LeBron face off with Kobe Bryant? Which years and games were these? 

How many times did Kobe Bryant go against LeBron's Miami team with Chris and Wade?

How many times did Kobe Bryant go against LeBron's Cavaliers teams? 

Also has LeBron went against anyone else like Shaq, Allen Iverson, Carmelo Anthony, Yao Ming, etc? What years, games, teams and the outcome of these?

Sorry if these questions seem stupid, I just wasn't really into basketball like that during those times and don't really know/remember much about what happened back then in the NBA or with players. Google results are everywhere with things so I figured I'd ask on here and get a more direct, complete response and information. 

Thanks in advance. Just tryna learn more about NBA history, more about one of my favorite player's history and about history of greats going against each other",What exactly is the history between LeBron James and Kobe Bryant?

nba,This would least lessen the chances of them occuring. A similar thing happened when Davis hit a great shot and then stepped on the fucking sign and turned his ankle. Why are we giving the players so little space? It's a travesty. Furthermore Trae was barely able to inbound the ball when the sixers crowd were enveloping him.  The damn ref had to be crowd control then,I can not believe that this game was decided on Trae stepping on the ref's foot. the nba needed to go back to the bubble format with court side seats 6 feet further back to give more room on the sidelines

nba,"Let’s say he’s hired in the off-season going into the year 1990. He has all his coaching skill from the modern day- but he can’t remember anything about the 90’s players. So like, he’ll have memory of all things NBA in the 2010’s and further, but he doesn’t know anything about any NBA players in the 90’s, he only knows the information that’s been made available since before the year 1990. 

So he’ll know Michael Jordan is a great player, but has no idea that he’d gone on to win 6 rings. Shaq will come into the league eventually and he’ll have never heard of Shaq or know anything about where his career will go in the future.

If you’re to lazy to click the link: 

Harden in 137 total games has…

• 11 games shooting 18 % or worse from the field

• 23 games shooting 29 % or worse from the field

• 54 games shooting 38 % or worse from the field 

• Only 46 games has he shot 48 % or better from the field 

• 19 pts or less in 51 games




NBA Finals. (2012)

Albeit a 6th man at the time &amp; not a superstar player he was still great in the Western Conference Playoffs &amp; playing like a star up to this point but Harden was a big disappointment in the Finals. 

12.4 ppg 4.8 rpg 3.6 apg on 37.5 % Fg 31.8 % 3pt 79.2 % Ft


In Games 1, 3 &amp; 4 Harden was at his worst averaging 7.3 ppg 5.3 rpg 3.6 apg on a combined 6-26 from the field (23 %) &amp; 2-11 from 3 (18 %) in 32 MPG. 

Games 3 &amp; 4 were most glaring seeing how both games were winnable. Durant &amp; Westbrook did their part but Harden didn’t do his.


First Round vs Okc. (2013) 

To be fair this was his first playoff series as the man of a team. He had his counting numbers but you can argue he only had 2 impactful star like games. Games 5 &amp; 6.

26.3 ppg 6.7 rpg 4.5 apg 4.5 turnovers per game on 39.1 % Fg 34.1 % 3pt 80.3 % Fts


First Round vs Blazers. (2014) 

Hardens 2nd series as a lead guy didn’t go well, he had an even worse series than the year prior. Harden shot 37 % or worse from the field in 4 of the 6 games. Just like last year..

26.8 ppg 4.7 rpg 5.8 apg on 37.6 % Fg 29.6 % 3pt 90.0 % Fts


First Round vs GS. (2016)

James Harden had 2 good games this series out of 5 total. He was however very inefficient in the first 4 games of the series in entirety. His stats may not look bad but they’re highly skewed.

26.6 ppg 5.2 rpg 7.6 on 41.0 % Fg 31.0 % Fts 84.4 % Fts



Semi-Finals vs Spurs. (2017) 

Hardens counting numbers looked good but again it was him failing to show up in the important series deciding games that made the difference. Game 6 was as embarrassing as it gets.

24.5 ppg 4.7 rpg 9.7 apg on 41.4 % Fg 30.8 % 3pt &amp; 83.3 % Fts


Harden was actually good for as many games than he was bad. The 3 bad ones were glaring though.

Gm 2: 13 pts, 3-17 from the field, 4 turnovers (more TOs than FGs made)

Gm 5: 0-3 from the field with 3 turnovers in OT

Gm 6: 10 pts, 6 turnovers on 2-11 from the field &amp; 2-9 from 3


Conference Finals vs GS. (2018) 

To be fair the Warriors are amazing, if they ramsack HOU that’s one thing, but the fact that they had a chance to win &amp; he underperformed in the last 2 games has to be brought up.

So many people pressures Giannis to stack the deck like Bron and KD did. And if he wins a championship anyway that would be extremely important to me.

nba,"We see right now how effective Giannis is in the paint. It's only when he settles for jumpers when the Bucks get in trouble. If he could learn how to get post positioning and use his pivot foot in the paint, it would solve all his offensive woes he has in the playoffs. Great athleticism, his size covers a lot of ground. Plus his mid range jumper could develop pretty quickly since he would be shooting it in rhythm from a spin/turn around move. Most of the time he will be matched up with someone smaller than him but it really wouldn't matter who they have him defending. He can already run in the open floor with ease. The possibilities are endless for Giannis and his team if he had a post game. No one saying he has to be just like Hakeem, but having that same style of play, especially in the post season, would be extremely difficult to beat.",Giannis could probably be one of the greatest players of all time if he modeled his game after Olajuwon.

nba,,Can the Lakers actually pull off a Damian Lillard trade?
nba,"Thunder trades for Dame and agrees with Kawhi to sign. It would be hilarious and savage at the same time if it happens. They first take Clippers' picks and then their free agent as well. Basically Thunder will rebuild in 2 seasons. And they will still have assets to trade for defensive big like Ben Simmons or Myles Turner. 

Core of Dame-SGA-Kawhi-Simmons would be pretty sick. Honestly, I think they should do it because it would still probably take a lot of luck to find similar talent with the picks they have. 

I know Kawhi will still probably won't want to play for them... but imagine they also move to Seattle! This sub will explode. I am just hoping for this kind of F5 season.",Can the Thunder pull out a PG move themselves?
nba,"This year's playoffs with all the crazy injuries to all these star players reminded me of Kobe Byrant's 2010 season and his playoff run.

Kobe played in all playoff games during the 2010 championship run and won a ring while playing with a broken index finger in his shooting hand. 

Essentially, he re-crafted his entire shooting motion to adjust to the injury and played through it.

&gt; Bryant suffered an avulsion fracture in two places near the tip of the [index] finger on Dec. 11 2009 as he tried to field a low Jordan Farmar pass. Bryant kept playing despite a projection of needing at least six weeks to heal – and he played pretty well. He was the Western Conference Player of the Month for December.

&gt; He wound up also the NBA Finals MVP, and he got there by refashioning his shooting stroke to put more pressure on the ball with his thumb and middle finger – trying to use the splinted index finger only as a guide. With the help of Lakers assistant coach Chuck Person, Bryant retooled his entire follow-through.

&gt; He kept playing because he was told the bone fragments could heal while he played, although he could only play if he endured brutal treatments to minimize swelling in the finger. The pressure applied to the finger by Lakers trainer/wizard Gary Vitti was akin to squeezing a tube of toothpaste with maximum force.

His finger was so bad that specialists thought he would never be able to play again without without wearing support for his damaged right index finger. [Here's a great article on the injury.](https://www.ocregister.com/2010/06/29/kobes-finger-might-never-be-right-again/)

nba,"the amount of slander the bucks, especially giannis gets is absurd in the media and by nba watchers. giannis averages 30/15/5 and gets called a robin and a taller ben simmons and people say the bucks have an easy path to the finals. why no talk about the suns? have had an all star injured in every series. Ad on the lakers, murray on the nuggets and Kawhi on the clippers. i have no problem with the suns but idk why the ""analysts"" and fans never bring that up. they just wanna see the bucks choke...again ):   bucks in 5 (:    (from a bucks fan)

i also forgot to mention the obliteration of a healthy heat team and a now 2-1 lead on a healthy hawks beside the 1 and a half quarters of a trae young rolled ankle. also the nets were arguably a more difficult opponent than all of the suns matchups",slander of deer
nba,I know everybody is gonna be saying Kobe was a clone of Michael Jordan and I agree to a certain extent.  Kobe used a lot of Michael’s moves in terms of scoring in the midrange and out of the post.  In his early years he slashed a lot too but it wasn’t reminiscent of jordan.  Wade meanwhile was fearless when driving to the rim and he was probably having one of the best slashing seasons ever in 09.  His defense was also on par with Jordan’s even with the shot blocking and help defense.,Was prime Wade (08-09) the closest player we’ve seen to jordan?
nba,"While it's worth noting that Shaq and Dwight have had more attempts than Ayton who has currently shot 151 FGA in 14 games: Shaq in 1998 did it with 258 FGA in 13 games and in 2006 with 291 FGA in 23 games; Dwight did it in 2009 with 268 FGA in 23 games, it's also worth noting that Ayton is the only one of them shooting over 70% during this year's playoff run and is also younger and earlier into his career than they were.

With Phoenix playing anywhere from 3 to 10 more playoff games this postseason, Ayton has even more opportunities to build on his noteworthy performance.

While Deandre Ayton was definitely overshadowed by fellow draft classmates Luka Doncic and Trae Young, it's clear that this young man has so much potential and could be one of the more dominant big men in the game soon.","Players since 1997 who have shot at least 60% from the field during the playoffs on at least 150 shots: Shaq (2x), Dwight Howard, Deandre Ayton."

They said that we had gone ""radio silent as an attempt to let the worst of the furor die down before they had to answer any difficult questions."" (also keep in mind, they retweeted things as recently as two days ago, so apparently any social media team who doesn't tweet every single day has gone radio silent, regardless of the fact that they have been eliminated from the playoffs for nearly a month)

Despite the fact that the hiring was not official at the time, and thus the team was not able to tweet about it, OP was extremely confident about the going-ons of the Portland Trail Blazers social media team. Contrary to their own statement, they went tinfoil

Now that the hiring has been made official, the team has tweeted about it being official, less than an hour after it happened.

nba,"Giannis has has nine 30/10 games so far throughout this postseason. The most since Shaq, and the comparisons between their dominance’s only become more apparent.

He also had a really long streak of 25/10 before Game 2 vs the Hawks.

An all time great playoff run is being ignored so people can make fun of 3 extra seconds in free throws

nba,"I know, I know. It sounds crazy, but there is a scenario where the Nets and the Sixers both come out as huge winners in this trade!

I’ll outline the deal here:

**Nets receive:**

Ben Simmons

**Sixers receive:**

Spencer Dinwiddie (sign and trade, 4 yr $17 mil per)

Joe Harris

2021 1st round pick

2028 1st round pick

#How the Nets Win

The Nets have 3 all time scorers. They need defense. Ben Simmons is an elite 1-5 defender who can also distribute if necessary. On offense, Ben can play in the dunker spot and chill. On defense, he can go all out and be Draymond Green on steroids.

Very easy win.

#How the Sixers Win

The Sixers need two things really badly. They need to surround Embiid with shooters, and they need a primary ball handler who can shoot. Dinwiddie can easily be their primary ball handler and can feed Embiid in the post. That’s all they need, plus, Dinwiddie is a stud scorer in my eyes. Not elite, but in this scenario, we’re trying to commit 110% to helping Embiid lead the Sixers to a championship.

Joe Harris is a bonafide sniper. He can hit threes consistently and would instantly be their best shooter.

Even if you don’t think that’s enough, the two first round picks should get it to about even in my eyes.

#Overall

Neither team takes on or frees up any salary cap, so there is no financial struggle with this trade. This trade is a win-win all around. If I’m Sean Marks or Daryl Morey, I am trying to bang out this deal as soon as possible. It improves both teams by a lot.
